  *Component* 
-First I created components folder called components, which will allow me to breakdown my applications into parts which can be composed to make more complex.
-The root components holds all component UIs
app.js is main application and will be the parent of all other components
-Next I added files , the parents components holds 5 children components(Header, footers,pomodoro,todoContainer, layoutContainer)
Since app.js is in used , i split and decompose the compomnent into smaller unit,  anotherparent component(roots component label LayoutContainer). LayoutContainer renders all the contents/customer componensts
-The headers renders the header contents, footers componets render footer ,pomodoro componets render pomodoro contents.
Header in src components folder, renders header comopents, which also renders the pages(Home,Walkthrough,Featues and Logins)
inside header.js i add my route  link 
next i added footer

About component: 
- create 2 containers for the hero section and context, i used two container so so i can use flexbox to center the content 
- i added aboutHero images, i added css to to make sure it cove some half of the page and so the text to be clear
